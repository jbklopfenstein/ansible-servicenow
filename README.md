# Intro to ansible-servicenow project
* * *
Welcome to the ansible-servicenow project.

This is a simple Ansible playbook for adding Roles and Tasks within a Block and Rescue structure which allows the customization of additional REST API callback actions.

This simple structure allows deployment and operations teams to share a common playbook that has been standardized for a specific set of actions while supporting their individual Roles.

The example playbook provided here has the specific action of connecting to a Cisco CSR router in an AWS account, making a change to an interface, and then calling a ServiceNow API to update ticket status.  Other roles and/or tasks can be added as well.

The follow-up API call to ServiceNow will close a given ticket as successful or unsuccessful depending on whether or not all playbook actions completed successfully.
